<h1><a name="C2"></a>Chapter 2: <a name="i0"></a>Common features</h1>
<p>
This chapter describes features that are common to all the games.
</p>
<h2><a name="S2.1"></a>2.1 <a name="i1"></a>Input</h2>
<p>
This page describes the how to interact with the games on the Symbian platform, the game specific controls remain unchanged from the original documentation, so some actions may not be available.
</p>
<h3><a name="S2.1.1"></a>2.1.1 S60 3rd Edition</h3>
<dl><dt>
<a name="i2"></a><em>Move cursor</em>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i3"></a><em>Primary action</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Press the middle button on the joystick for the primary action.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i4"></a><em>Secondary action</em>
</dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt>

</dl>
<h3><a name="S2.1.2"></a>2.1.2 S60 5th Edition</h3>
<dl><dt>
<a name="i6"></a><em>Virtual keypad</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Since the touch screen phones don't have a keypad, some buttons were added to the bottom of the screen to input numbers and also for shortcuts for &#8216;Undo&#8217; (&#8216;U&#8217; button) and &#8216;Redo&#8217; (&#8216;R&#8217; button) actions.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i7"></a><em>Actions</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Use the stylus pen to interact with the game. To alternate between primary and secondary actions (most games support them) a button on the bottom of the screen can be used to switch between them. When the primary action is active, the button will display &#8216;S&#8217;, when the secondary action is active it will display &#8216;/&#8217;.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i8"></a><em>Numbers</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Use the virtual keypad to choose a number for games that support them.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="S2.2"></a>2.2 <a name="i9"></a>Common actions</h2>
<p>
These actions are all available from the <a name="i10"></a>&#8216;Game&#8217; menu and via <a name="i11"></a>keyboard shortcuts, in addition to any game-specific actions.
</p>
<dl><dt>
<a name="i12"></a><em>New game</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Starts a new game, with a random initial state.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i13"></a><em>Restart game</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Resets the current game to its initial state. (This can be undone.)
<p>
When exiting the application or when selecting a different game the current game is saved automatically.
</p>
<p>
When selecting a game the last saved state is automatically loaded.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i14"></a><em>Undo</em> (&#8216;*&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Undoes a single move. (You can undo moves back to the start of the session.)
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i15"></a><em>Redo</em> (&#8216;#&#8217;)
</dt>
<dd>
Redoes a previously undone move.
</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i16"></a><em>Solve</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Transforms the puzzle instantly into its solved state. For some games (Cube) this feature is not supported at all because it is of no particular use. For other games (such as Pattern), the solved state can be used to give you information, if you can't see how a solution can exist at all or you want to know where you made a mistake. For still other games (such as Sixteen), automatic solution tells you nothing about how to <em>get</em> to the solution, but it does provide a useful way to get there quickly so that you can experiment with set-piece moves and transformations.
<p>
The &#8216;Solve&#8217; command adds the solved state to the end of the undo chain for the puzzle. In other words, if you want to go back to solving it yourself after seeing the answer, you can just press Undo.
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<a name="i17"></a><a name="i18"></a><em>Quit</em>
</dt>
<dd>
Closes the application entirely.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a name="S2.3"></a>2.3 The &#8216;Type&#8217; menu</h2>
<p>
The <a name="i19"></a>&#8216;Type&#8217; menu, if present, may contain a list of <a name="i20"></a>preset game settings. Selecting one of these will start a new random game with the parameters specified.
</p>
<p>
The &#8216;Type&#8217; menu may also contain a &#8216;<a name="i21"></a>Custom&#8217; option which allows you to fine-tune game <a name="i22"></a>parameters. The parameters available are specific to each game and are described in the following sections.
